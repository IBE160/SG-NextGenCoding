# Story Quality Validation Report

**Story:** 2-1-user-registration-with-email-and-password - User Registration with Email and Password
**Outcome:** PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 2)

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

1.  **Vague Citation in Dev Notes**: The reference `[Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-2.md]` is too broad. It should point to a specific section within the document to improve traceability.
2.  **Incomplete Previous Story Learnings**: The "Learnings from Previous Story" section does not explicitly list all new files created in the previous story (1.4). While it captures the essence of the changes, listing the files would be more thorough.

## Successes

-   All critical and major quality checks passed.
-   The story is well-structured and adheres to the defined format.
-   Acceptance Criteria are clear, testable, and correctly sourced from the technical specification.
-   Tasks are well-defined and mapped to the Acceptance Criteria.
-   Dev Notes provide specific and relevant guidance.
-   Continuity from the previous story is mostly captured, including warnings.
