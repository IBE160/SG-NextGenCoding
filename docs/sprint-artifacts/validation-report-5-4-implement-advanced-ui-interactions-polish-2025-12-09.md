## Summary
- Overall: PASS with issues (0% failed)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### 1. Load Story and Extract Metadata
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

### 2. Previous Story Continuity Check
Pass Rate: 2/2 (100%) - N/A for continuity expected as previous story is drafted.

### 3. Source Document Coverage Check
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)
Evidence: All relevant existing documents (PRD, Epics, Architecture) were cited and files verified. Non-existent documents were correctly identified as N/A.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Quality Check
Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)
Evidence: ACs extracted correctly from epics.md, match the source, and are testable, specific, and atomic.

### 5. Task-AC Mapping Check
Pass Rate: 3/4 (75%)
[⚠ PARTIAL] Count tasks with testing subtasks - Testing subtasks < ac_count (1 < 3)
Evidence: Only one explicit testing subtask is present, while there are three distinct acceptance criteria. Ideally, each AC should have a dedicated testing task or be clearly covered by existing testing tasks to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
Impact: Potential for incomplete testing coverage for some acceptance criteria.

### 6. Dev Notes Quality Check
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
Evidence: Required subsections are present (Architecture, References). Content is specific, and citations are present and accurate.

### 7. Story Structure Check
Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)
Evidence: Story status is 'drafted', format is correct, Dev Agent Record sections are initialized, Change Log is present, and file is in the correct location.

### 8. Unresolved Review Items Alert
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%) - N/A as no previous story in 'done', 'review' or 'in-progress' status.

## Failed Items
(none)

## Partial Items
[⚠ PARTIAL] Count tasks with testing subtasks - Testing subtasks < ac_count (1 < 3)
Recommendation: Consider adding more granular testing subtasks for each acceptance criterion to ensure explicit test coverage.

## Recommendations
1. Should Improve: Consider adding more granular testing subtasks for each acceptance criterion to ensure explicit test coverage.
