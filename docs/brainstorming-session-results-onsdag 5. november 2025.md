# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** onsdag 5. november 2025
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Expanding the core functionality of the "Lecture Notes - Summary & Quiz generator" application.

**Session Goals:** To explore new feature ideas, identify potential blind spots, and create a roadmap for future development.

**Techniques Used:** SCAMPER, What If Scenarios, Analogical Thinking

**Total Ideas Generated:** 13

### Key Themes Identified:

*   **Personalization and Adaptive Learning:** Tailoring the experience to individual user needs.
*   **AI-Driven Feedback:** Leveraging AI to provide real-time, interactive guidance.
*   **Expanding Scope:** Evolving from a single-purpose tool to a comprehensive learning ecosystem.

## Technique Sessions

### SCAMPER

*   **Substitute:** Support for more file types (Word, PowerPoint, articles).
*   **Combine:** Interactive quizzes with real-time, adaptive AI feedback.
*   **Adapt:** A teacher-centric platform with student performance analytics.
*   **Modify:** Variable length and depth for summaries and quizzes.
*   **Put to another use:** A general-purpose "information on demand" and conversational learning tool.
*   **Eliminate:** Anonymous access for one-off summarizations without saving history.
*   **Reverse:** A topic-first approach where users get information and quizzes on a subject they choose.

### What If Scenarios

*   **Unlimited Resources:** A comprehensive teaching assistant that generates lecture presentations and semester plans.
*   **Voice-Activated Assistant:** A conversational learning experience.
*   **Group-Focused Design:** Collaborative study features, competitive quizzes, and peer-to-peer feedback.

### Analogical Thinking (Fitness Tracker)

*   An AI-powered "learning coach" that provides personalized advice.
*   Structured "study plans" that guide users through a learning path.

## Idea Categorization

### Quick Wins

*   Interactive quizzes with real-time, adaptive AI feedback.
*   Variable length and depth for summaries and quizzes.
*   Anonymous access for one-off summarizations without saving history.

### Promising Concepts

*   Support for more file types (Word, PowerPoint, articles).
*   A general-purpose "information on demand" and conversational learning tool.
*   A topic-first approach where users get information and quizzes on a subject they choose.
*   Structured "study plans" that guide users through a learning path.

### Bold Moonshots

*   A teacher-centric platform with student performance analytics.
*   A comprehensive teaching assistant that generates lecture presentations and semester plans.
*   A voice-activated assistant for conversational learning.
*   Group features for collaborative study (competitive quizzes, shared summaries, chat).
*   An AI-powered "learning coach" that provides personalized advice.

### Insights and Learnings

*   The potential to shift from a "bring your own content" model to a "discover new content" model.
*   The opportunity to serve two distinct user groups: individual learners and educators.

## Action Planning

### Top Priority Idea: Variable length and depth for summaries and quizzes.

*   **Rationale:** Allows users to fit summaries and quizzes to their needs.
*   **Next steps:** Implement a UI slider to select length/depth, and modify backend prompts to the AI.
*   **Resources needed:** Existing resources are sufficient.
*   **Timeline:** Approximately 1 week.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

The combination of different brainstorming techniques was effective in generating a wide range of ideas, from incremental improvements to transformative new concepts.

### Areas for Further Exploration

Support for more file types (Word, PowerPoint, articles) is a key area for future investigation.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

A Mind Map would be useful for planning the technical implementation of supporting more file types.

### Questions That Emerged

How to maintain a clear focus on the MVP while strategically planning for the implementation of new features.
